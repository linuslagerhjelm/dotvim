# .vimrc
This is a the file for my vim configuration. Use it if you like to

Running the included installation script will takes care of installing
everything for you and set you upp propperly
This can be done by running corresponding script from the folder that this file
is in. The installation script only works in OSX where homebrew is installed.
For other systems, manual installation is required

**Also please note:** the installation script will install a newer version of
vim and make it default on your system.


Mac:
``` sh install.sh ```
